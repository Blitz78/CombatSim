# CombatSim
Python Code where you can execute a simple combat simulation 

Combat Sim is a bit of Python Code inspired by Dungeons & Dragons where a user can enter the name of their character and the character's race then proceeding to run a simulation on if those two characters fought. 

This is primarily a POC where the objective was to create a game using python code that can accept a wide variety of variables from users and provide a uniquely randomised result each time. 

Additionally the user would be able to rerun the simulation as many times as they wanted without having to execute the code each time.
